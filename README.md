## Introduction
This website contains five visualization charts of five datasets, implemented in D3.js. The five visualizations are:
1. Bubble Plot
2. Scatter Plot
3. Histogram
4. Heatmap
5. Density Plot

I have also included a description of the findings from the analysis of the visualizations. This supports the concept of data-driven insights.

## Installation
No installation of packages or libraries is needed, as I directly link to the hosted D3.js script

## Usage
Double-click the index.html file to view the visualizations

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome using pull requests.
